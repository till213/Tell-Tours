## How To Setup A Tour

### Announce

If you want to reach the most people the easiest way is probably to:

#### Flight Simulator Forum
- Announce your upcoming tour(s) on the [Flight Simulator Communty Fly-In Events forum](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/c/community/community-fly-in-events/) by creating a new [calendar entry](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/c/community/community-fly-in-events/l/calendar)
  - Example: https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/tell-tours-switzerland-from-north-to-south-leg-1/335342
  - The description does not have to be as long as in the given example, but it should contain the following information:
    - What is the purpose (sight-seeing, bush flying, IFR flying, ...)
    - Type of airplane(s)
    - Server, communication (voice chat) and optional weather settings
    - Who is the expected audience ("everyone welcome", "experienced pilots", "knowledgable in ATC communication", ...)
    
#### MSFS Discord Server    
- Use the official **Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) Discord server** for communication & streaming: https://discord.gg/msfs
 - You also need to announce your tour in Discord in order that the MSFS administrators know about it and open up the "event channel"
 - Do so by filling out the form that you find pinned at the top of the **#community-flyins** text channel (under "How to submit an event")
 - It is highly recommended to link to your previously generated announcement in the [Flight Simulator Communty Fly-In Events forum](https://forums.flightsimulator.com/c/community/community-fly-in-events/)
 
 ### Pre-Flight Check
 
 - Communication (usually restricted to Discord *push to talk* settings!) will take place in one of the two **Event #1** / **Event #2** voice channels (in the [EVENTS] section on the left-hand side on Discord)
 - They are normally *locked* (only *one* person is allowed to join)
 - In order to have an event channel *unlocked* (and renamed to something like "My Flight Tour") ask an MSFS administrator like 30 minutes before the event (reference your scheduled event by name or by URL)
 - You see which administrators are online on the right-hand side: simply give them a note e.g. in the **#flight-events-bot** channel, by prefixing their name with an **@**
   - Example: "Hello **@NameOfAdministrator**, I am online and preparing my 4th leg of "Tell Tours - Switzerland" (https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/tell-tours-switzerland-hot-potato-leg-4/345071/). I am currently in channel *Event #2*"
 - They usually react within a minute or so and *unlock* the corresponding event channel for you
 - You can then talk ("push to talk"!) to your participants and share (stream) your FS 2020 application
 - After the event it is polite to let them know that they can *lock* the event channel again, e.g.:
   - "Hello **@NameOfAdministrator**, the "Tell Tours - Switzerland" event is officially over, the event channel can be closed again. Thank you!"
