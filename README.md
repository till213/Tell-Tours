# Tell-Tours

Community flights with the Flight Simulator 2020 where you will learn (fun) facts about the visited locations. 

The first *Tell Tours* flight took place in Switzerland on December 16 2020. Home of (legendary figure) William Tell - hence the name *Tell* Tours (but which also refers to *show & tell*) ;)

Who knows... maybe in the future this will be a place for more *Tell Tours* around the world. Pull requests welcome :)
