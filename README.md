# Tell-Tours

Community flights with the Flight Simulator 2020 (and other flight simulators) where you will learn (fun) facts about the visited locations. 

The first *Tell Tours* flight [Leg 1](https://github.com/till213/Tell-Tours/tree/main/Europe/Switzerland/Steeler/Leg-1) took place in Switzerland on December 16 2020. Home of (legendary figure) William Tell - hence the name *Tell* Tours (but which also refers to *show & tell*) ;)

Who knows... maybe in the future this will be a place for more *Tell Tours* around the world. Pull requests welcome - or ask me to be added as github.com collaborator to this repository. :)

## Purpose

This repository shall both serve as an archive for flight plans (e.g. &ast;.pln for Flight Simulator 2020) and guide's notes about the visited locations as well as an "online notebook" for upcoming community flights.
