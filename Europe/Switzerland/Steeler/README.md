# Tell Tours - Switzerland

A flight of four legs will guide us through Switzerland:

* [Zurich to Locarno](https://github.com/till213/Tell-Tours/tree/main/Europe/Switzerland/Steeler/Leg-1)
* [Locarno to Bern Belp](https://github.com/till213/Tell-Tours/tree/main/Europe/Switzerland/Steeler/Leg-2)
* Bern Belp to Geneva
* Geneva to St. Moritz

On the way you will hear fun facts, about Switzerland's history (including William Tell, of course), about movie locations and everything else you want to ask during the flights.
