# Tell Tours - Switzerland

A flight of four legs will guide us through Switzerland:

* [Zurich to Locarno - "From North to Sout"](https://github.com/till213/Tell-Tours/tree/main/Europe/Switzerland/Steeler/Leg-1)
* [Locarno to Bern Belp - "On Her Majesty's Secret Service"](https://github.com/till213/Tell-Tours/tree/main/Europe/Switzerland/Steeler/Leg-2)
* [Bern Belp to Geneva - "Smoke on the Water"](https://github.com/till213/Tell-Tours/tree/main/Europe/Switzerland/Steeler/Leg-3)
* [Geneva to Samedan - "Hot Potatoe"](https://github.com/till213/Tell-Tours/tree/main/Europe/Switzerland/Steeler/Leg-4)

On the way you will hear fun facts, about Switzerland's history (including William Tell, of course), about movie locations and everything else you want to ask during the flights.
