# Geneva (LSGG) to Samedan (LSZS)

## Geneva Airport (LSGG)

* A simple airfield was established **in 1919** in Cointrin (near Geneva)
* From **1926 to 1931**, the airfield's wooden sheds were replaced by **three concrete hangars**
* By **1930**, there were **six airlines** that flew to Geneva Airport on **seven different routes**.
* As part of the Federal Government's **post-war planning for the nation's airports**, Cointrin was noted as being well suited for extension ...
* ... and did **not require a triangular runway arrangement** as the **prevailing winds** are very regularly along a single axis
* To provide for jet traffic, **in 1960** the runway was extended to its current length of **3,900 m (12,800 ft)**
* This is **unusually long** for an airport of this size, ...
* ... and could **only be built after some territory was exchanged** between **France** and **Switzerland**
* The runway extension needed to use land that was then French, and an **international agreement was needed** whereby the **necessary land was transferred from France to Switzerland**, and territory of **identical size**, also adjacent to Ferney-Voltaire, **transferred in the opposite direction**
* In this way, Switzerland remained exactly the same size, and **its neutrality remained unsullied**
* Despite there never being a regular **Concorde** service in Switzerland, **the supersonic aircraft twice landed in Geneva**
* On **31 August 1976**, more than **5000 people came to see** the Concorde land
* The current number of **passengers** flying through Cointrin is around **15 million per year**
* For comparison: **Zürich Kloten (LSZH)** has **31 million passengers** per year (2019)
* The airport has a **single concrete runway (04/22)**, which is the **longest in Switzerland with a length of 3,900 m (12,795 ft)** and one of the **longest in Europe**, making it open to use by aircraft of all existing sizes
* The runway had been known as **05/23 until September 13**, **2018**, when it was **changed to 04/22 due to the North Magnetic Pole moving**

## Airport Sion (LSGS)

* Airport of the city of Sion, Switzerland and is located 2.5 km southwest of Sion city in the **Rhone Valley**
* Because of the **redimension of the Swiss Air** Force it left Sion after **2018** and Sion is **used by civil aviation only**, acting only as alternate airfield for the Air Force

## Sion

* Sion is one of the **most important pre-historic sites** in Europe
* The site has been settled nearly continuously **since antiquity**
* The oldest trace of human settlement comes from **6200 BC** during the late Mesolithic
* Around **5800 BC** early **Neolithic farmers** from the Mediterranean settled in Sion
* The **settlements** remained **small** until **about 4500 BC**, during the middle Neolithic, when the number of settlements increased sharply
* From the **middle of the 14th century to 1475**, the history of Sion was filled with **wars and destruction**
  - In **1352**, Sion was conquered, pillaged and plundered by an **army from Savoy**
  - Sion was attacked and looted in **1384**, again during the **Raron affair** (a 15th-century rebellion in the Valais against the power of a **local noble family**, the Raron family)
  - in **1418** and finally in *1475* during the **Burgundian Wars**
* The *17th* and *18th* *Centuries* were a **peaceful** time in Sion
* After the **French invasion** of Switzerland on **5 March 1798**, Sion was caught between the **revolutionary spirit**
* Following the creation of the **Helvetic Republic in May 1789** (an early attempt to impose a central authority over Switzerland), a **counter-revolutionary rebellion erupted in the upper Valais**
* This short-lived rebellion was **crushed on 17 May 1789 by French and Vaudois troops** and **Sion was plundered**
* In **May 1799** **counter-revolutionary** forces from **Upper Valais** looted the city again
* After **Napoleon's defeats** during the War of the Sixth Coalition the **Valais was occupied by Austria** at the end of **December 1813**
* Under the **Austrians**, the citizenry received many of their **rights back**
* In **1840**, the **Upper and Lower Valais were reunited**
* But **four years later** (**1844**), Sion was **occupied by Upper Valais** troops during the beginning of the **Sonderbund War**
* **Federal troops** occupied Sion in **November 1847**
* was a civil war in Switzerland
* The **Sonderbund War of November 1847** was a **civil war in Switzerland**, then still a relatively loose confederacy of cantons (states)
* It ensued after **seven Catholic cantons formed the Sonderbund** ("separate alliance") in 1845 to protect their interests against a centralization of power
* The war concluded with the **defeat of the Sonderbund**
* It resulted in the emergence of Switzerland as a federal state in 1848
* The **Sonderbund** consisted of the cantons of **Lucerne, Fribourg, Valais, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Zug**, all predominantly **Catholic** and governed by **conservative administrations**
* **Public Airshows** have been held at the airfield of Sion
* Aerobatic teams such as the **Frecce Tricolori** from Italy and the **Patrouille de France** have performed there

## St. Moritz

* St. Moritz is a high Alpine resort town in the Engadine in Switzerland, at an elevation of about **1,800 metres** (5,910 ft) above sea level
* It hosted the **Winter Olympics** in **1928** and **1948**
* Pilgrims traveled to Saint Mauritius often to the church of the springs, where they drank from the **blessed, bubbling waters of the Mauritius springs** in the hopes of being healed
* In **1519**, the Medici pope, Leo X, promised **full absolution** to anyone making a pilgrimage to the church of the springs
* **September 1864**, St. Moritz hotel pioneer **Caspar Badrutt** made a wager with **four British summer guests**: they should return in winter and, in the event that the village was not to their liking, he would reimburse their travel costs
* If they were to find St. Moritz attractive in winter, he would invite them **to stay as his guests for as long as they wished**
* This marked not only the **start of winter tourism in St. Moritz** but the start of winter tourism **in the whole of the Alps** 
* The **first electric light in Switzerland** was installed in **1878** at the Kulm Hotel, and ...
* ... the first **curling tournament** on the continent was held in **1880**
* St. Moritz hosted the **1928 Winter Olympics** and again in **1948**
* It has also hosted many other events since, including some unlikely ones **on the frozen lake** in the 1970s and 1980s such as a **golf tournament**, (1979), a **snow polo tournament** (every year in January starting in 1985) and **Cricket on Ice** (1989)
* Every winter it hosts the **"White Turf" horse race** on the **frozen Lake St. Moritz** attended by the international upper class
