- Under the terms of this treaty, any **incoming aircraft after 22:00** had to approach Zürich from the east **to land on runway 28** , which, unlike the airport's other runways, **was not equipped with an instrument landing system**.
- **A month later,** at 22:06 on 24 November, an **inbound Crossair Avro RJ100** using this approach in conditions of **poor visibility crashed** into a range of hills near **Bassersdorf** and **exploded, killing 24 of the 33 people on board**.
- **The flight had originally been scheduled to land on runway 14 before 22:00** , but it was **subject to delay** and was therefore diverted to runway 28.

- ... who **opened a breach** in the Habsburg lines **by throwing himself into their pikes** , ...
- ... taking them down with his body so that the confederates could attack through the opening.
- Winkelried is **usually explained as a legendary figure introduced to explain the Swiss victory against the odds** , perhaps as late as a full century after the battle.
- The earliest evidence of the Winkelried legend is the depiction of the battle in the Lucerne Chronicle of 1513.

## RÜTLISCHWUR

- The **Rütlischwur** is the **legendary oath** taken at the foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy **by the representatives** of **the three founding cantons, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden,**** traditionally dated to 1291**
- It is **named for the site** of the oath-taking, the Rütli, a meadow above Lake Uri near Seelisberg.
- Recorded in Swiss historiography from the 15th century, the oath is **notably featured in the play William Tell** (Wilhelm Tell) **by Friedrich Schiller (1804).**

- **Werner Stauffacher** of Schwyz was threatened by **reeve Gessler** (Vogt) because **he had dared to build a stone house.**
- Stauffacher escaped to Uri, and **formed a secret pact against the reeves** (Vögte).

- The report from **Chronicon Helveticum** by **Aegidius Tschudi** (c. **1570** ) became the **canonical form in Swiss historiography**.
- Tschudi retains the names of the three oath-takers (Eidgenossen)
  - **Werner Stauffacher** for Schwyz,
  - **Walter Fürst** for Uri and
  - **Arnold of Melchtal** for Unterwalden.
- **Tschudi** dates the **oath to 1307**

- The **building of Switzerland as a federal state** in the **first half of the 19th century** (1803–1848) **revived symbols** of the period of growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy in the Late Middle Ages, ...
- ... **including the legends of William Tell** and **Arnold Winkelried** and the **Rütli oath**.
- After the establishment of the federal state, **the Rütli oath became associated with the Swiss Federal Charter, a document dated to 1291**.
- This choice was not straightforward, as it **went against Tschudi's date of 1307** , ...
- ... and historians could enumerate **a total of 82 similar documents** of the period of **1251 to 1386**.

- The **decision was motivated pragmatically** , as the **modern Swiss capital of Bern in 1891 was going to celebrate the 700th anniversary of the city's foundation**...
- ... and it was **convenient to place the 600th anniversary of the Confederacy in the same year**.


## ALTDORF

- **Especially in Central Switzerland** , the opportunistic re-dating of the event was **resented** , and the **Rütli oath ...**
- **... continued to be dated to 1307 well into the 20th century**.
- Accordingly, the **600th anniversary** of the Confederacy was **celebrated** _ **again** _ **in 1907** , this time **in Altdorf**.

- It was only after the **celebration of the 650th anniversary in 1941** , seen as an **important symbol of Swiss independence in times of war** , ...
- ... **that the date of 1291 became universally associated with the Rütli oath**.
- The **Swiss national holiday on 1 August**** marks the date of the Federal Charter**(dated to "the beginning of August, 1291),**and thus the Rütli oath.**

- Following a **public vote on 26 September 1993** , 1 August has been **an official national holiday since 1994**.

- **Painted yellow** , it now served as an **advertisement for chocolate**.

- **In 1923** , there were **plans to demolish** it, but it was **preserved on the initiative** of **Max Oechslin, president of Naturforschende Gesellschaft Uri**.

- **In 1970,** the Devil's Stone was **again scheduled for destruction** , to make way for the **N2 motorway**.
- This time, there was **a broad movement to preserve it** , and in 1971, **federal authorities agreed to move the stone,** with projected costs of **250,000 francs**.
- This led to a **popular campaign opposing the plan** because the **cost was seen as excessive**.
- The **cantonal government now argued** that there was no legal basis for the destruction of the stone because it had been the **property of Naturforschende Gesellschaft Uri since 1925**.
- On **1 September 1972** , the **Federal Council**** finally agreed to moving the stone **, and it** was moved 127 metres in an operation costing CHF 335,000**.

- It is **now situated on the ramp of exit 40 (Göschenen)** of the motorway, at the **entrance of Gotthard Road Tunnel** , ...

- ... visible both from the railway and from the motorway.


## DEVIL'S BRIDGE

- **Schöllenen Gorge** (Schöllenenschlucht)
- In Early Modern Switzerland, a legend developed **which attributed the construction of the bridge to the Devil.**
- The name **Teiffels Brucken** ("Devil's Bridge", modern German: Teufelsbrücke) is **first recorded in 1587**.

- Legend: **the people of Uri recruited the Devil** for the difficult task of building the bridge.
- The **Devil requested to receive the first thing to pass the bridge** in exchange for his help.
- To trick the Devil, who expected to receive the soul of the first man to pass the bridge, ...
- ... the people of Uri **sent across a dog by throwing a piece of bread** , and the dog was **promptly torn to pieces by the Devil**.

- A **modern retelling** was published by **Meinrad Lienert** , Schweizer Sagen und Heldengeschichten ( **1915** ).
- According to Lienert's version, **a goat was sent across the bridge** instead of a dog

- The **legend does not appear to have existed before the 16th century** , and its origin in local tradition is uncertain.
- **Lauf-Belart (1924)** surmised that the name Teufelsbrücke was **originally due to an erroneous interpretation by learned travellers** , ...
- ... **which only in the 17th century gave rise to the local legend involving the Devil**.
