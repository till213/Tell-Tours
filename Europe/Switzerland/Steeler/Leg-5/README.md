## Canton Appenzell
- The name Appenzell derives from Latin: abbatis cella ("cell (i.e. estate) of the abbot")
- This refers to the Abbey of St. Gall, which exerted a great influence on the area
- Starting in 1522, followers of Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli began to preach the Protestant Reformation in Appenzell
- To end the confrontation between the old and new faiths, the Landesgemeinde decided in April 1525, that each parish should choose a faith, ...
- ... but that the principle of free movement would be supported, so that the religious minority could attend the church of their choice regardless of where they lived
- The entire Ausserrhoden converted to the Reformation in 1529, with the exception of Herisau, whereas the Innerrhoden remained with the old faith, with the exception of Gais
- The Catholic victory in the Second War of Kappel in 1531 ended plans for a reformation of the entire Canton of Appenzell
- After the Second War of Kappel, the two religions reached a generally peaceful parity
- They remained united by common business interests
- Nonetheless: peaceful partition of the canton in 1597
- Women's voting rights only in 1990
- Voting rights for women were again rejected at the Landsgemeinde with a ratio of 3:2, despite the strong recommendation by the Great Council
- A new initiative (Initiativkomite) requested another voting
- In 1991 following a decision by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, Appenzell Innerrhoden became the last Swiss canton to grant women the vote on local issues
- General voting rights for women in Switzerland only in 1971
- Legend: «Di vestreute Appezölle Hüüsli»
- The Giant Säntis liked the buildings so much that he put them all into a bag
- A farmer was able to cut a hole into the bag and one by one all buildings dropped out of the bag...
- ... while the giand Säntis was walking across the Appenzeller country
- Once the giant Säntis noticed what he had done he actually liked the new location of the buildings
- And so they remained spread over all the countryside until today :)

- The so-called Säntismord (English: Säntis murder) happened in the winter of 1922
- It refers to a crime in which the weather station keeper Heinrich Haas and his wife Maria Magdalena were murdered
- The murder was only discovered because of missing weather reports on 21 February
- As a result of the missing reports, a search party was sent to Säntis, where they discovered the bodies
- The prime suspect was shoemaker Gregor Anton Kreuzpointner, who committed suicide three weeks after the murder
- The truth about this double murder hence remains unclear to this day
- Swiss radio channels such as DRS 1, DRS 2, DRS 3, RSR la Première and RSI Rete Uno are broadcast from the tower

## Einsiedeln Abbey
- **Einsiedeln Abbey** (German: Kloster Einsiedeln) is a **Benedictine monastery**
- The abbey is dedicated to **Our Lady of the Hermits**, the title being derived from the circumstances of its foundation, for the first inhabitant of the region was **Saint Meinrad, a hermit**
- Meinrad was a monk and was ordained a priest
- After some years at Reichenau, he embraced an eremitical life and established his hermitage on the slopes of mount Etzel
- He died on January 21, 861, at the hands of two robbers who thought that the hermit had some precious treasures, but during the next 80 years the place was never without one or more hermits emulating Meinrad's example
- One of them, named Eberhard, previously Provost of Strassburg, in 934 erected a monastery and church there, of which he became first abbot
- It has been a major resting point on the Way of St. James (Jakobsweg) for centuries
- In 1854, when the monastery was again facing suppression, a colony was sent to the United States from Einsiedeln to minister to the local German-speaking population and to develop a place of refuge, if needed
- The delegation started a new foundation, now St. Meinrad Archabbey in St. Meinrad, Indiana, which became part of the Swiss-American Congregation formed in 1881
- As of 2020, the Swiss-American Congregation consists of seventeen monasteries from Canada to Guatemala, six of which were founded from the lineage of Einsiedeln Abbey (St. Meinrad Archabbey, Subiaco Abbey, St. Joseph Abbey, Marmion Abbey, San Jose Priory, and Prince of Peace Abbey)

## Battle of Morgarten
- The Battle of Morgarten occurred on 15 November 1315, when the men of Schwyz, with support of their allies of Uri and Unterwalden, ambushed a Habsburg army under the command of Duke Leopold I on the shores of Lake Ägeri, in the territory of Schwyz
- Toward the end of the 13th century the House of Habsburg coveted the area around the Gotthard Pass, as it offered the shortest passage to Italy
- However, the Confederates of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, which had formalized the Swiss Confederacy in 1291, held imperial freedom letters from former Habsburg emperors granting them local autonomy within the empire
- In 1314 tensions between the Habsburgs and Confederates heightened when Duke Louis IV of Bavaria (who would become Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor) and Frederick the Handsome, a Habsburg prince, each claimed the crown of the Holy Roman Emperor
- The Confederates supported Louis IV because they feared the Habsburgs would annex their lands (which they had tried to do in the late 13th century). 
- War broke out after the Confederates of Schwyz raided the Habsburg-protected Einsiedeln Abbey
- The conflict with Einsiedeln erupted after settlers moved from Schwyz into unused parts of the territories claimed by Einsiedeln
- This led the abbot of Einsiedeln to complain with the bishop at Constance, who moved to excommunicate Schwyz
- In revenge for this, men of Schwyz under the leadership of Werner Stauffacher raided Einsiedeln abbey on the night of 6 January 1314
- They plundered the monastery, desecrated the abbey church, and took several monks as hostages
- The bishop now extended excommunication to Uri and Unterwalden as well as Schwyz
-Frederick's brother, Habsburg duke Leopold of Austria, led a large army to crush the rebellious Confederates
- Estimates of Habsburg forces range from a recent 2,000–3,000 over 9,000 up to (exagerated) 20,000 men (well-trained and -equipped knights)
- The Confederates of Schwyz were supported by the Confederates of Uri and Unterwalden
- The size of the Confederate force is unknown, with estimates ranging from 1,500 to around 3,000-4,000
- Regardless of numerical considerations, the main contrast between the two forces was that a well-equipped and trained medieval army was meeting an improvised militia of farmers and herdsmen
- Between Lake Ägerisee and Sattel, where a small path led between a steep slope and a swamp, they prepared an ambush
- The marching army would have been stretched out in a column of some 2 km along the path when the vanguard encountered a roadblock near Schafstetten
- The Confederates attacked the column, frightening the horses by throwing rocks from above and engaging the mounted knights with halberds
- About 1,500 men were said to have been killed in the attack; 
- according to Johannes von Winterthur (writing ca. 1340), this number does not include those drowned in the lake
- According to Karl von Elgger, the Confederates, unfamiliar with the customs of battles between knights, brutally butchered retreating troops and everyone unable to flee
- He records that some infantry preferred to drown themselves in the lake rather than face the brutality of the Swiss
- Within a month of the battle, in December 1315, the Confederates renewed the oath of alliance made in 1291, initiating a period of growth within the Confederacy
- As the first military success of the Confederacy, Morgarten became an important staple of Swiss patriotism in the early modern period
- In 1891, in the context of the 600-years anniversary of the Confederacy, plans were made to erect a new memorial at the site of battle
- There was some dispute as to the appropriate location (not least because the "battle" was an attack on a marching column stretched out for some 2 kilometres), with both the cantons of Schwyz and of Zug claiming the site of the battle
- A monument was eventually inaugurated in 1908 at the southern shore of Lake Ägeri, in the village of Hauptsee, in the canton of Zug
- There was some dispute as to the appropriate location (not least because the "battle" was an attack on a marching column stretched out for some 2 kilometres), with both the cantons of Schwyz and of Zug claiming the site of the battle
- A monument was eventually inaugurated in 1908 at the southern shore of Lake Ägeri, in the village of Hauptsee, in the canton of Zug
- On this occasion, the village was renamed to "Morgarten"
- The authorities of Schwyz refused to acknowledge a site of the battle outside of their territory and did not send any official representation to the monument's inauguration ceremony

## Lucerne

- Lucerne is the capital of the canton of Lucerne and part of the district of the same name

- Lucerne is unique in that its three wooden pedestrian bridges, the 14th-century Hofbrücke (now destroyed) and Kapellbrücke and the 16th-century Spreuerbrücke, all featured painted interior triangular frames
- None of Europe's other wooden footbridges have this feature
- The paintings, dating back to the 17th century and executed by local Catholic painter Hans Heinrich Wägmann, depict events from Lucerne's history

- Lucerne is home to the Luzerner Sinfonieorchester, a category A symphonic orchestra, and to the 21st Century Symphony Orchestra, and they both hold most of their performances in the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre
- Every year, towards the end of winter, Fasnacht (Carnival) breaks out in the streets, alleyways and squares of the old town
- This is a glittering outdoor party, where chaos and merriness reign and nothing is as it normally is
- Strange characters in fantastic masks and costumes make their way through the alleyways, while Guggenmusiken (carnival bands) blow their instruments in joyful cacophony and thousands of bizarrely clad people sing and dance away the winter

- After around 600 deliveries in six decades, Pilatus produced the last one in early 2019
- The PC-6 is noted for its Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) performance on almost any type of terrain
  - it can take off within a distance of 640 feet (195 m) and 
  - land within a distance of 427 feet (130 m) while carrying a payload of 2,646 lbs (1,200 kg)
- Thanks to its STOL performance, the PC-6 holds the world record for highest landing by a fixed-wing aircraft, at 18,865 feet (5,750 m), on the Dhaulagiri glacier in Nepal
- During the 1960s and 1970s, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)-controlled airline Air America operated up to 23 PC-6s at a time
- Many of these were operated in the South-East Asia region, including South Vietnam during the Vietnam War
- The type was used for various missions including paradropping supplies to troops, passenger transport, psy ops, reconnaissance, prisoner conveyance, airborne radio relay, and other intelligence operations

## RÜTLISCHWUR

- The **Rütlischwur** is the **legendary oath** taken at the foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy **by the representatives** of **the three founding cantons, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden**, traditionally **dated to 1291**
- It is **named for the site** of the oath-taking, the Rütli, a meadow above Lake Uri near Seelisberg.
- Recorded in Swiss historiography from the 15th century, the oath is **notably featured in the play William Tell** (Wilhelm Tell) **by Friedrich Schiller (1804).**

- **Werner Stauffacher** of Schwyz was threatened by **reeve Gessler** (Vogt) because **he had dared to build a stone house.**
- Stauffacher escaped to Uri, and **formed a secret pact against the reeves** (Vögte)

- The report from **Chronicon Helveticum** by **Aegidius Tschudi** (c. **1570** ) became the **canonical form in Swiss historiography**
- Tschudi retains the names of the three oath-takers (Eidgenossen)
  - **Werner Stauffacher** for Schwyz,
  - **Walter Fürst** for Uri and
  - **Arnold of Melchtal** for Unterwalden
- **Tschudi** dates the **oath to 1307**

- The **building of Switzerland as a federal state** in the **first half of the 19th century** (1803–1848) **revived symbols** of the period of growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy in the Late Middle Ages, ...
- ... **including the legends of William Tell** and **Arnold Winkelried** and the **Rütli oath**
- After the establishment of the federal state, **the Rütli oath became associated with the Swiss Federal Charter, a document dated to 1291**
- This choice was not straightforward, as it **went against Tschudi's date of 1307**, ...
- ... and historians could enumerate **a total of 82 similar documents** of the period of **1251 to 1386**

- The **decision was motivated pragmatically**, as the **modern Swiss capital of Bern in 1891 was going to celebrate the 700th anniversary of the city's foundation**...
- ... and it was **convenient to place the 600th anniversary of the Confederacy in the same year**

## Altdorf

- **Especially in Central Switzerland**, the opportunistic re-dating of the event was **resented**, and the **Rütli oath ...**
- **... continued to be dated to 1307 well into the 20th century**
- Accordingly, the **600th anniversary** of the Confederacy was **celebrated** _ **again** _ **in 1907**, this time **in Altdorf**
- It was only after the **celebration of the 650th anniversary in 1941**, seen as an **important symbol of Swiss independence in times of war**, ...
- ... **that the date of 1291 became universally associated with the Rütli oath**
- The **Swiss national holiday on 1 August** marks the date of the Federal Charter (dated to "the beginning of August, 1291), **and thus the Rütli oath.**
- Following a **public vote on 26 September 1993**, 1 August has been **an official national holiday since 1994**

- **Painted yellow**, it now served as an **advertisement for chocolate**
- **In 1923**, there were **plans to demolish** it, but it was **preserved on the initiative** of **Max Oechslin, president of Naturforschende Gesellschaft Uri**
- **In 1970,** the Devil's Stone was **again scheduled for destruction**, to make way for the **N2 motorway**
- This time, there was **a broad movement to preserve it**, and in 1971, **federal authorities agreed to move the stone,** with projected costs of **250,000 francs**
- This led to a **popular campaign opposing the plan** because the **cost was seen as excessive**.
- The **cantonal government now argued** that there was no legal basis for the destruction of the stone because it had been the **property of Naturforschende Gesellschaft Uri since 1925**
- On **1 September 1972**, the Federal Council finally agreed to moving the stone, and it was **moved 127 metres in an operation costing CHF 335,000**
- It is **now situated on the ramp of exit 40 (Göschenen)** of the motorway, at the **entrance of Gotthard Road Tunnel**, ...
- ... visible both from the railway and from the motorway

## DEVIL'S BRIDGE

- Legend: **the people of Uri recruited the Devil** for the difficult task of building the bridge
- The **Devil requested to receive the first thing to pass the bridge** in exchange for his help
- To trick the Devil, who expected to receive the soul of the first man to pass the bridge, ...
- ... the people of Uri **sent across a dog by throwing a piece of bread**, and the dog was **promptly torn to pieces by the Devil**
- A **modern retelling** was published by **Meinrad Lienert**, Schweizer Sagen und Heldengeschichten (**1915**)
- According to Lienert's version, **a goat was sent across the bridge** instead of a dog
- The **legend does not appear to have existed before the 16th century**, and its origin in local tradition is uncertain
- **Lauf-Belart (1924)** surmised that the name Teufelsbrücke was **originally due to an erroneous interpretation by learned travellers**, ...
- ... **which only in the 17th century gave rise to the local legend involving the Devil**

## SUWOROW MONUMENT

- **Suworow-Monument**, 12 metres high
- **Built 1899 in memory of the fallen of the battle**...

- In the opening years of the **Second World War** the **plan was expanded and refined to deal with a potential German invasion**.
- The term " **National Redoubt**" primarily refers to the **fortifications begun in the 1880s** that **secured the mountainous central part of Switzerland**, ...
- ... providing a **defended refuge for a retreating Swiss Army**.
- This strategy was intended to **deter an invasion altogether by denying Switzerland's crucial transportation infrastructure to an aggressor**.
