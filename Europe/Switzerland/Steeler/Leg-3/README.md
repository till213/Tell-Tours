## Swiss Political System – Facts and Figures

### Direct democracy
* **Popular initiative**: citizens the right to propose an **amendment** or **addition** to the **Constitution**
  -  **100,000 voters** who support the proposal must be collected within **18 months**
* The **optional referendum** allows the people to demand that any bill approved by the Federal Assembly is put to a nationwide vote
  -  **50,000 valid signatures** must be collected within **100 days of publication** of the new legislation
* All **constitutional amendments approved by parliament are subject to a mandatory referendum**, i.e. they must be put to a nationwide popular vote
  - The electorate are also required to approve **Swiss membership of specific international organisations**
* The Swiss electorate are called on approximately **four times a year** to exercise this right

### The Federal Assembly (parliament)
* The **Swiss Parliament** (**"Bundesversammlung"** - **Federal Assembly)** has a total of **246 members**, who are directly elected by the people
* Switzerland has a **bicameral parliament**: the **National Council (200 members)** and the **Council of States (46 members)**
* The **Federal Assembly** is the **legislative power** of Switzerland
* Its two chambers – the **National Council** (**"Nationalrat"**) and the **Council of States** (**"Ständerat"**) –have the **same powers but meet separately**
* The number of representatives sent by each canton depends on the size of its population
* **15 political parties** are represented in the **Swiss Parliament**
* Those **parties with the largest share** of the popular vote are **represented on the Federal Council**
* According to the **consociational model** of democracy adopted in Switzerland, left-wing, right-wing and centrist parties all **share executive power**

### Federalism
* Although its official name is the **Swiss Confederation** ("Eidgenossenschaft" - for historical reasons), Switzerland has, in fact, been a federal state ("Bundesstaat") **since 1848**
* The powers of the Confederation are limited to those areas explicitly entrusted to it by the Federal Constitution
* Responsibility for all other matters, such as **education**, **health** and **policing**, fall to the **cantons**, which enjoy a high degree of policy-making autonomy in these areas

### The Federal Council
* The **Federal Council** (Bundesrat) is the highest executive authority of the Swiss Confederation
* Its members **represent Switzerland’s main political parties**
* The **Swiss federal government** (the **Federal Council**) is made up of **seven members**, who are **elected by parliament**
* Each Federal Councillor is appointed to serve a **one-year term as President of the Confederation by the Federal Assembly** in accordance with the principle of seniority  
* The Federal President chairs the **sessions of the executive** and undertakes special **ceremonial duties**, particularly abroad
* As a **collegial body**, the Federal Council must remain **unanimous when presenting cabinet decisions to the public**, even if it is **contrary to their personal view or to the official line taken by their party**
* At the present time, the Federal Council has two representatives from the **Liberal Party (FDP)**, two representatives from the **Swiss Social Democratic Party (SP)**, two representatives from the **Swiss People’s Party (SVP)**, and one representative from the **Swiss Christian Democratic Party (CVP)**
* Each member of the Federal Council also heads a **federal department**

  - Three women (out of seven Federal Councillors)

### Women in Politics

* Women in Switzerland gained the **right to vote** in **federal elections** after a referendum in **February 1971**
* In **1991** following a **decision by the Federal Supreme Court** of Switzerland, **Appenzell Innerrhoden (AI)** became the **last Swiss canton** to grant women the **vote on local issues**
  - AI is the smallest Swiss canton with c. 14,100 inhabitants in 1990


### Comparison with the Oldest Democracy

* The **oldest democracy is the USA**, with its constitution come into effect in **1789**: "We the People..."
* **Switzerland** is the second-oldest democracy, since **1848**
* Third is **New Zealand (1857)**, the first self-governing colony to allow women the rights to vote in parliamentary elections
* No other countries in the world have such strong direct democratic people’s rights as the United States and Switzerland
* But unlike the Swiss, Americans don’t have a say at the national level
* However half of the USA country’s 50 states are familiar with the particularities of the people’s initiative and the referendum (also known as the people’s veto)
* Indeed, **modern direct democracy** – characterised by **votes on initiatives and referendums** – shapes everyday political life in the US as in almost no other country in the world – except Switzerland
* It’s no coincidence that the two federalist states have **strongly influenced one another in the past**
* In a historical sense, Switzerland copied the **concept of federalism from the United States**, while the US took the idea of **direct democracy from Switzerland**
* But in fact, **neither the Americans nor the Swiss were the inventors of these concepts**, which are important elements of our political systems today 
* Today, it is considered a fact that **Benjamin Franklin** – one of the founding fathers of the US – took his inspiration for the writing of the first **American federalist constitution** from the **Iroquois Native American tribe**
* Credit for the development of **direct democracy** and **people’s rights** concepts goes to the **French Marquis de Condorcet**, a “Renaissance man”
* At the **French Constitutional Convention in 1792**, Condorcet explained that **“active and personally engaged citizens are a prerequisite”**
* As a result, he **proposed the right to a people’s initiative**
* Neither **France nor Condorcet survived the subsequent turmoil** (**French Revolution**), however, and so today the French constitution is devoid of the strongest of all people’s rights
* In neighbouring Switzerland, however, Condorcet’s ideas found fertile ground
* Both the **people’s initiative** and the **referendum** were adopted in **almost all Swiss cantons** before finding their way **into the Federal Constitution in 1891**
* This peaceful revolutionary development caught the attention of American journalists at the end of the 19th century * They set out on a field trip to learn about democracy in Switzerland
* The reporter **J. W. Sullivan** so thrillingly described the “Swiss model” in his **newspaper articles and books** that the topic of **direct democracy soon left its mark on the debate over political reforms in the US**
